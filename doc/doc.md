To help new team members gain context about the major decisions we have made we will document them in this repo.

Each decision goes in the ```arch``` folder containing sections on:

* Context
* Decision
* Alternatives considered
* Status (optional, used to indicate when deprecated)
* Consequences (optional, updated in the future to document the negative impacts of the choice)

These documents are intended to be light weight.
